This repository contains the Matlab code to estimate a 4-dimensional latent factor model 
that simultaneously captures the dynamics of the Estr OIS term structure and the EURIBOR term structure.
The code is part of ongoing research by Flavio Angelini, Stefano Herzel and Marco Nicolosi 
and is made available for use upon request to the authors. The authors do not take any 
responsibility for errors or inaccuracies in the code.
